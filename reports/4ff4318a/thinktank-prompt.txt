# MCP Server Security Analysis: modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem

## Automated Security Scan Results

### Summary Statistics
- SAST Findings: 22
- Known Vulnerabilities: 0 total
  - Critical: 0
  - High: 0
  - Medium: 0
- Exposed Secrets: 0
- Total Dependencies: 0

## Critical Analysis Question

**Is this MCP server safe for production deployment? What is the risk level?**

## Analysis Framework Required

### Key Risk Areas to Evaluate:
1. **Path Traversal & Access Control** - Can the server be exploited to access unauthorized files?
2. **Input Validation** - Are user inputs properly sanitized?
3. **Dependency Security** - Are there known CVEs in dependencies that are exploitable?
4. **Secret Exposure** - Are credentials or API keys exposed?
5. **Attack Surface** - What are the primary attack vectors?
6. **Exploitability** - Are the identified issues theoretical or practically exploitable?

### Required Perspectives:
1. **Security Hardening** (Conservative) - Focus on worst-case scenarios
2. **Risk Pragmatist** (Balanced) - Weigh severity vs likelihood
3. **Operational Context** (Practical) - Consider deployment mitigations

### Output Requirements:
1. Overall security verdict: APPROVED / FLAGGED / REJECTED
2. Trust score: 0.0 - 1.0
3. Critical findings that block deployment
4. Medium findings for security roadmap
5. Recommendations for remediation
6. Confidence level in assessment

### Context
This analysis will be published to the Credence MCP Security Registry and used by developers to evaluate server trustworthiness.

Provide a thorough, evidence-based assessment that balances security rigor with practical deployment considerations.
